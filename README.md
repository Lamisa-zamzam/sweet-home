# Sweet Home

## House rental website

This responsive project provides a number of houses which you can rent. It also has [Firebase Authentication System](https://firebase.google.com/docs?authuser=0) for better user experience. You can create an account using email and password or Google. There is a card for each house and by clicking the 'see details' button, if you are logged in, you go to the booking page and you can pay with credit card and rent it. Your renting data will be saved to the database [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/). Through the admin page, you are allowed to add and delete any service and make another admin through the make admin page. You can see all the orders that you have made on our website in the booking list page and if you are an admin, you can see all the orders that have been made by the users and edit the status of any house rent that a user has made. Last but not least, this website uses private routing form [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form validation.
